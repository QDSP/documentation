\chapter{Introduction}



This report will document the work of group 4 with a project that is part of the course SSE1, E12 "Agent Oriented Programming". The main objective of this project is to implement an agent oriented solution to a problem. The report will describe the different parts of the development of the agent based solution. It will introduce the reader to the problem statement, discuss how the agents have been assigned to different tasks and describe the implementation. At the end of the report ideas for futher development, that have not been implemented, will be described.

In order to read this report it is assumed that the reader has basic knowledge about agent oriented programming, the JAVA based JADE environment and the FIPA protocol, since this will not be described in depth through the report.
